## DEVELOPERS

### INTRODUCTION

A standard weather app, provides tracking of current weather conditions
and weather forecast for the given particular location in real time. We
are developing a weather app, to provide better visualisation using
Augmented Reality as well as providing better user experience. This app
could be a more dependable and effective pre-disaster information
transmission system that might improve public emergency responses and
allow individuals to evacuate and take protective measures before and
during a disaster.
